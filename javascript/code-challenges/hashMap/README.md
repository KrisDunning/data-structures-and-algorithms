## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

Feature Tasks
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
Arguments: string
Return: string

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Space : O(n) - space directly related to number if words in the input string.
Time : O(1) - map data structure utilizes O(1) lookup

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->

in the hashmapRepeatedWords.js file. Simply call the repeatedWords function and pass in a string of words. Will either return the first instance of a repeated word, or 'No repeated words'.
